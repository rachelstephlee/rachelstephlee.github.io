I am a Computational Cognitive Neuroscientist who focuses on modeling and has strong interests in Theoretical Neuroscience. I was trained in Cognitive Modeling (specifically, connectionist modeling), but these days I work on Dopaminergic Models of Reinforcement learning. 

I enjoy working on interdisciplinary research problems that study cognitive behaviors by modeling neuroscience data. My research interests are broad because I don't have a particular preference for the cognitive behavior I study, the type of dataset I model, or the modeling methodology. I am excited by modeling work that have interesting theoretical implications for neuroscience and/or cognitive science. These days I prefer working with rodent behavioral + neural data. I have a strong interest in doing more theoretical work.




# Non-Research Projects

A smattering of random projects outside of academia that I've done.

1. After college, I spent about two years pursuing Product/Program Management in the Bay Area. I interned at Tableau Softwares (2015 Summer). I worked for Microsoft Powerpoint for a full year (2016 - 2017). My main project for MSFT PPT was Accessibility i.e. I helped develop features that help blind and deaf users use MSFT PPT effectively. Microsoft subsequently won the Helen Keller Achievement Award from the American Foundation for the Blind in 2018 for their contributions to accessible technology. 

2. In highschool, I spent several summers working for Stanford's REAP Program to help rural children in China have better access to education.
